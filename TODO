Ideas:

  * API docs
    * document classes / methods inline
    * create HTML docs
    * move some of the docs from the README to the HTML docs
  * Provide standard way to store data
  * Tie event API together with existing pmatic.api and synchronize objects and
    their states somehow
  * How to deal with events? Provide standard way to keep scripts running for
    a longer time and make them able to listen for events.
  * For the CCU:
    * Standardize script path
    * Add some kind of scheduling mechanism for scripts (use homematic ones?)
    * Add interface to manage scripts and jobs as alternative to just deploy
      the files e.g. via SSH.
