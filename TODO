Fixes:
* Schedules might be executed/rescheduled multiple times while editing
  -> need to track the last execution time somewhere
  * ConditionOnDeviceEvent implement to_state()

Todos:
* Change names of specific devices to use underscores
* Create test for ChannelMaintenance.maintenance_state
* Manager:
  * persist things to keep them during restarts
    * resident states
    * schedule states (last trigger, last result)
  * Transaction-IDs einbauen, so dass man nicht aus Versehen Aktionen doppelt ausf√ºhrt.
  * Tests for the manager
  * Events: Close on shutdown when registered?
  * Make editing of scheules only possible when not currently running?
  * Reboot peristent state_dir?
* Residents / presence:
  * Add resident arrive / leave as event to the event log
* Cleanup: set_submitted_vars() shows: Cleanup access to channel by address to
  have an API equal to getting a device from devices or param from channel.
* Docs:
  * pmatic.utils
  * The parameter classes and parameter types
* Improve error handling of TCL errors like in https://github.com/LarsMichelsen/pmatic/issues/7

Optimizations:
* Ship precompiled *.pyc files for faster startups even on first load?
* Events: Only register when there is at least one script asking for events

Ideas:
* Use better APIs?:
  - Talk directly with Rega (8181)?
  - Get rid of json API, use XML / XML-BIN-APi?
  - Use rfd or whatever low level APIs?
* Provide standard way to store data on the local system
* Create Object based access to the system variables of the CCU
