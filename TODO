Ideas:

* Talk directly with Rega (8181)
* Provide standard way to store data on the local system
* Create Object based access to the system variables of the CCU
* Ship precompiled *.pyc files for faster startups even on first load?
* Manager:
  * Make it possible to disable the CCU connection by config
  * Configurable scheduling of scripts
  * Add option "disabled" to schedules to temporarly disable specific schedules
  * Implement "keep running" option of schedules
  * Add confirm dialog for script deletion
  * Add confirm dialog for schedule deletion
  * Tests for the manager
  * Escape user provided texts
  * Events: Close on shutdown when registered?
  * Events: Only register when there is at least one script asking for events
  * Cleanup: Stop running scripts when schedules are deleted.
  * Make editing of scheules only possible when not currently running?
* Cleanup: Parameters should use .name just like other objects instead of .title
* Cleanup: set_submitted_vars() shows: Cleanup access to channel by address to
  have an API equal to getting a device from devices or param from channel.
* FIX: CCU object: After ccu.events has initialized all objects, mark the devices
  of the CCU object as already initialized. listAllDevices is not needed anymore then.
