Todos:
* Manager:
  * Tests for the manager
  * Events: Close on shutdown when registered?
  * Make editing of scheules only possible when not currently running?
* Residents / presence:
  * Add resident arrive / leave as event to the event log
  * how to use residents in inline and non inline scripts?
* Cleanup: set_submitted_vars() shows: Cleanup access to channel by address to
  have an API equal to getting a device from devices or param from channel.
* Doc: Document the parameter classes and parameter types
* Renew CCU connection when credentials have changed or connection has been enabled/disabled
* pmatic-manager.log - Rotation einrichten.

Optimizations:
* Ship precompiled *.pyc files for faster startups even on first load?
* Events: Only register when there is at least one script asking for events

Ideas:
* Talk directly with Rega (8181)
* Provide standard way to store data on the local system
* Create Object based access to the system variables of the CCU
