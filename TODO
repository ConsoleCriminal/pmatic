Fixes:
* Schedules: Are device events state changes/updates working?

Todos:
* Manager:
  * Tests for the manager
  * Events: Close on shutdown when registered?
  * Make editing of scheules only possible when not currently running?
  * Reboot peristent state_dir?
* Residents / presence:
  * Add resident arrive / leave as event to the event log
* Cleanup: set_submitted_vars() shows: Cleanup access to channel by address to
  have an API equal to getting a device from devices or param from channel.
* Docs:
  * pmatic.utils
* Improve error handling of TCL errors like in https://github.com/LarsMichelsen/pmatic/issues/7

Optimizations:
* Events: Only register when there is at least one script asking for events

Ideas:
* Use better APIs?:
  - Talk directly with Rega (8181)?
  - Get rid of json API, use XML / XML-BIN-APi?
  - Use rfd or whatever low level APIs?
* Provide standard way to store data on the local system
* Create Object based access to the system variables of the CCU
* Timeperiod management
  * Create custom timeperiods like "sleep time" 22:00 - 07:00
  * Use them in scripts like this:
    if pmatic.times.is("sleep time"):
        # ... do something ...

  * Or event based:
    pmatic.times.on_start("sleep time", call_custom_function_start)
    pmatic.times.on_end("sleep time", call_custom_function_end)
