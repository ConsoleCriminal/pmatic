Ideas:

* API docs
  * document classes / methods inline
  * create HTML docs
  * move some of the docs from the README to the HTML docs
* Provide standard way to store data on the local system
* Create Object based access to the system variables of the CCU
* For the CCU:
  * Standardize script path
  * Add some kind of scheduling mechanism for scripts (use homematic ones?)
  * Add interface to manage scripts and jobs as alternative to just deploy
    the files e.g. via SSH.

* Bugs:
  * Recursion exception in examples/print_temperature_updates.py
