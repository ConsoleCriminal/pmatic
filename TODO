Ideas:

* Talk directly with Rega (8181)
* Provide standard way to store data on the local system
* Create Object based access to the system variables of the CCU
* For the CCU:
  * Standardize script path (/etc/config/addons/pmatic/scripts)
  * Add some kind of scheduling mechanism for scripts (use homematic ones?)
  * Add interface to manage scripts and jobs as alternative to just deploy
    the files e.g. via SSH.
