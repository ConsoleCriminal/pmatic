Ideas:

* Talk directly with Rega (8181)
* Provide standard way to store data on the local system
* Create Object based access to the system variables of the CCU
* Ship precompiled *.pyc files for faster startups even on first load?
* Manager:
  * Configurable scheduling of scripts
  * Make caching of static files possible
  * Add confirm dialog for script deletion
  * Tests for the manager
  * Escape user provided texts
  * Events: Close on shutdown when registered?
  * Events: Only register when there is at least one script asking for events
  * Event-Log: Make length of event history configurable
* Cleanup: Parameters should use .name just like other objects instead of .title
